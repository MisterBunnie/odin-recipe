    <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towel and trim off excess fat. Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, herbs,
        salt and pepper.
        Coat the chicken evenly with the combined seasoning.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and sear chicken thighs in batches until
        browned on each side and no longer pink in centre (about 8 minutes each side, depending on thickness).
        Add remaining oil if needed for second batch.Transfer to a plate; set aside and keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>To the same pan or skillet, melt the butter and add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook until
        soft (about 3 minutes). Add the garlic, parsley, thyme and rosemary; saut√© until fragrant (about 1 minute).</li>
    <li>Stir in cream, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and continue cooking until sauce has thickened slightly. Stir
        in the parmesan cheese and allow it to melt through the sauce for a further 2 minutes, while occasionally
        stirring.</li>
    <li>Return chicken to the pan. Taste test and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Garnish with fresh parsley.
        Serve immediately.</li>
