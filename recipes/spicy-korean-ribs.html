    <h1>Spicy Korean Ribs</h1>
    <img src="../img/skr.jpg" alt="Spicy Korean Ribs">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's known as Dwaeji Galbijjim in Korean.</p>
    <p> Pork ribs are slowly boiled and reduced in a savory blend of Korean spices - until the meat easily pulls off the
        bones.
    <p>Absolutely one of my favorite ways to eat ribs!</p>
    <p>This is a perfect weekend dish to drop at the center of the dinner table.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup kochujang (Korean hot sauce)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle pilsner-style lager</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons toasted black sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove membrane from back of ribs or score with a sharp knife.
            Place ribs in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Puree onion in a blender or food processor. Add kochujang, vinegar,
            garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, and minced ginger; puree into a sauce.
            Rub 1/3 generously over ribs, reserving the rest of the sauce.
            Cover ribs with plastic wrap and refrigerate 5 hours to overnight.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

        <li>
            Scatter sliced ginger root over the bottom of a roasting pan.
            Place ribs meat-side down on top of ginger slices and pour lager over ribs.
            Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until meat is loosened from the ribs
            but not yet falling off the bone,
            2 to 2 1/2 hours. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and
            lightly oil the grate. Place ribs on the grill and cook until browned,
            about 6 minutes per side. Coat with 1/2 the reserved sauce during the last
            2 minutes of cooking each side. Garnish with white and black sesame seeds.

    </ol>
